# Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon @ Montpellier, France 2021
We are extremely excited to hold the Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon in France! It's open to everyone and completely online.

It's a unique opportunity to get to know about Quantum Computing, coding with Qiskit (a quantum toolkit developed by IBM), and finish some cool projects together!


## Challenges
We are preparing some cool projects and they will be released soon! Of course, you are encouraged to create your own project! Any topics relevant to quantum computing are accepted. Note that, the utilization of Qiskit is obligatory. 

Here are some possible ideas:

Quantum game design, Paper implementation, Quantum Machine Learning, etc.
