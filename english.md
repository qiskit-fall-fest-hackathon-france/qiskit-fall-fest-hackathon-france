# Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon @ Montpellier, France 2021
We are extremely excited to hold the Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon in France! It's open to everyone in France or French-speaking and completely online.

It's a unique opportunity to get to know about Quantum Computing, coding with Qiskit (a quantum toolkit developed by IBM), and finish some cool projects together!


## Challenges
We are preparing some cool projects and they will be released soon! Of course, you are encouraged to create your own project! Any topics relevant to quantum computing are accepted. Note that, the utilization of Qiskit is obligatory. 

Here are some possible ideas:

Quantum game design, Paper implementation, Quantum Machine Learning, etc.

## Important notes
  * You are welcome to participate to our kick-off event physically on Friday afternoon 15th of October, at around 5 PM. We will announce the address once it's confirmed.
  * We will hold two Qiskit workshops before the hackathon. The first one is to help you install Qiskit and introduce the basis knowledge about quantum computing. It will last two hours. The second one is a one-hour fully Q&A session. You are welcome to ask any questions. The two workshops will be recorded so don't worry that you miss one of them! If you are a beginner in Quantum Computing or not familiar with Qiskit, just attend the Qiskit workshops!
  * The winning teams will obtain prizes and have the probability to be invited to the Qiskit Global Hackathon!
